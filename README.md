# Hi there, I'm Mohammad Reza Sadeghian 👋



I'm a Data Scientist specializing in transforming complex data into actionable insights. I'm currently completing my **Master of Science in Applied and Computational Mathematics** at Simon Fraser University.

I am passionate about building and deploying end-to-end machine learning solutions, developing robust statistical models, and creating interactive dashboards. My work often involves Python, R, and SQL, and I have hands-on experience in areas like Deep Reinforcement Learning, LLM pipelines, computer vision (CNNs), and bioinformatics.

### 🌱 My Key Projects & Experience

Here are some of the projects and experiences I'm most proud of.

#### 💼 Professional Experience

* **Data Analyst Intern | IOTO Corporation**
    * Engineered a dual-LLM pipeline to automatically analyze and verify parliamentary transcripts.
    * Built an ideological vectorization framework to map and cluster MPs' political stances.
* **Research Assistant | Simon Fraser University**
    * Developed custom computational tools for plasmid detection using Python/NetworkX and a hybrid classifier (ML + Integer Linear Programming).
* **Research Intern | Amirkabir University**
    * Designed a Deep Reinforcement Learning portfolio manager in PyTorch for cryptocurrency, improving Sharpe ratio and returns.

#### 🚀 Personal & Course Projects

* **Multi-City Public Transit Performance Analysis**
    * Built an automated Python pipeline to collect live transit data and store it in a PostgreSQL/PostGIS database.
    * Calculated KPIs (e.g., on-time performance) using advanced SQL and built an interactive Tableau dashboard.
* **Age and Gender Prediction from Chest X-rays**
    * Developed a multi-task deep learning pipeline in PyTorch, benchmarking CNNs like ResNet and DenseNet.
    * Implemented Bayesian hyperparameter tuning with Optuna and interpreted models using Grad-CAM.
* **Optimized Model Compression for Fine-Tuned Transformers**
    * Innovated a data-free compression method using the discrete wavelet transform, achieving over 5x compression with negligible accuracy loss.
